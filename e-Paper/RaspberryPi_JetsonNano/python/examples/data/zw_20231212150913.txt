This is a test of my new
typewriter,
I cna now scroll up and down
through previous files.
Eggs.

and when it gets to a new line,
it should push to the next spot.
when the file pushes too far,
the screen continues onwards.

and so, this continues.

hmm
this is an issue.


fsfsfsfs
sdfdfdsf
ffsfsf fsdfsfs
fdsfsdskjls sdkfjl

well then

This is an interesting problem.

what is the line of text here
and how will this impact

my ability to review previous
writing?


and when the cursor gets to the
beginning of a new page...

We can
keep going.
Hmm..
